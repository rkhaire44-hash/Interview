        <button class="accordion">1. Capital Reduction</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A Capital Reduction is when a company reduces its issued share capital, often to return excess cash to shareholders or to eliminate accumulated losses from its balance sheet.</p>
            
            <h4>Mechanics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Return of Capital:</strong> The company pays shareholders cash, reducing the nominal value per share.</li>
                <li><strong>Accounting Adjustment:</strong> The company cancels part of its paid-up capital to offset losses, with no cash changing hands.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example – Return of Capital</h4>
            <p>A company decides to return $0.20 per share. If you hold 5,000 shares, you receive 5,000 × $0.20 = $1,000 in cash. The share price may adjust downward by a similar amount.</p>
            
            <h4>Interview Q / Model Answer</h4>
            <blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> Why would a company do a capital reduction instead of paying a dividend?<br><strong>A:</strong> A capital reduction doesn't require distributable reserves, which dividends do. It's also a tool to clean up the balance sheet by writing off historical losses, making the company more attractive.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Share Cancellation</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Share cancellation occurs when a company repurchases its own shares and then permanently cancels them, reducing the total number of shares in existence.</p>
            
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A company with 100 million shares and $180 million in net income repurchases and cancels 10 million shares. Its new share count is 90 million.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Old EPS:</strong> $180M / 100M shares = $1.80</li>
                <li><strong>New EPS:</strong> $180M / 90M shares = $2.00</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The result is a higher EPS, which can lead to a higher valuation.</p>

            <h4>Interview Q / Model Answer</h4>
            <blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between share cancellation and treasury shares?<br><strong>A:</strong> Cancelled shares are permanently removed. Treasury shares are repurchased and held by the company, and can be reissued later (e.g., for employee stock plans).</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. ETF / Unit Trust Creation and Redemption</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>For Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Unit Trusts, creation and redemption is the process of issuing and cancelling units to meet investor demand. It's how these funds grow or shrink in size.</p>
            
            <h4>Mechanics</h4>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Creation:</strong> Authorized Participants (APs) deliver a basket of securities to the ETF provider, who in turn issues new ETF units. This increases supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Redemption:</strong> APs return ETF units to the provider and receive the underlying securities back. This decreases supply.</li>
            </ul>
             <p>This mechanism is key to keeping an ETF's market price aligned with its Net Asset Value (NAV).</p>

            <h4>Interview Q / Model Answer</h4>
            <blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> How do creations and redemptions help liquidity?<br><strong>A:</strong> They allow the ETF's supply to be dynamically adjusted. When demand is high, new units are created; when demand falls, units are redeemed. This prevents large price swings away from the fund's intrinsic value.</blockquote>
