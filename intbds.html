            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A foreign bond is issued by a non-domestic borrower in the domestic currency of the market where it’s issued. The issuer is foreign, but the bond is subject to local regulations, local market practices, and is cleared/settled locally.</p>

        <button class="accordion">2. Eurobonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A Eurobond is issued in a currency different from the home currency of the country or market where it’s issued. They are typically issued offshore (outside the jurisdiction of any single country) and traded internationally.</p>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Eurodollar Bond:</strong> Issued in USD outside the U.S. (e.g., by a German company in London).</li>
                <li><strong>Euroyen Bond:</strong> Issued in JPY outside Japan.</li>
                <li><strong>Euroeuro Bond:</strong> Issued in EUR outside the Eurozone.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Global Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Global bonds are issued simultaneously in multiple markets and listed on several exchanges. They combine features of Eurobonds and domestic bonds to reach the broadest investor base.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>The World Bank issues a Global USD Bond simultaneously in the U.S. (Yankee market), Europe (Eurobond market), and Asia. Investors across continents subscribe at the same time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">4. Emerging Market Sovereign Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Issued by governments or state-owned entities in emerging economies to raise foreign capital. They can be denominated in hard currency (e.g., USD, EUR) or local currency.</p>
            <h4>Risk & Reward Profile</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Higher yields due to sovereign risk.</li>
                <li>Often rated below investment grade.</li>
                <li>Sensitive to political stability, foreign reserves, and fiscal balance.</li>
                <li>Risks include currency, default, liquidity, and political/legal risk.</li>
            </ul>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A Brazil 10-year USD bond yields 8.2% vs. a U.S. Treasury 10-year at 4.6%. The ~3.6% difference is the EM risk premium.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">5. Brady Bonds (Historical)</button>
        <div class="panel">
             <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Brady Bonds were created in the late 1980s/1990s to restructure defaulted sovereign debt in Latin America. They converted bank loans into tradable bonds, often collateralized by U.S. Treasuries.</p>
            <h4>Relevance</h4>
            <p>Modern sovereign restructuring (like in Ukraine or Argentina) uses similar “Brady-style” exchange offers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">6. Sukuk (Islamic Bonds)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Sukuk are Sharia-compliant bond-like instruments. They do not pay interest (riba) but represent ownership in an asset, lease, or project, distributing profits instead of interest.</p>
            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Asset-backed, not debt-based.</li>
                <li>Compliant with Islamic law.</li>
                <li>Growing market in GCC, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia.</li>

             <ul>
                <li><strong>Currency Risk:</strong> FX fluctuations affect returns if the bond currency differs from the investor's home currency.</li>
                <li><strong>Sovereign Risk:</strong> The risk that a government defaults or imposes capital controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Risk:</strong> Policy shifts, expropriation, or instability can affect repayment.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some EM bonds trade thinly, leading to higher bid-ask spreads.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal/Settlement Risk:</strong> Legal enforcement risk across different jurisdictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rating Downgrade Risk:</strong> EM ratings are more volatile and can sharply reduce prices.</li>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Q: What’s the difference between a Yankee bond and a Eurodollar bond?</strong><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> A Yankee bond is issued by a foreign borrower in the U.S. market in USD, subject to U.S. SEC rules. A Eurodollar bond is issued outside the U.S. in USD, often without SEC registration.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Q: Why do EM sovereign bonds offer higher yields?</strong><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> They carry higher credit, political, and currency risk, so they compensate investors with higher returns (an EM risk premium).
            </blockquote>
             <blockquote>
                <strong>Q: How does a Sukuk differ from a conventional bond?</strong><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> A Sukuk represents ownership in an asset or project and pays profit/lease income instead of interest, to comply with Islamic law.
