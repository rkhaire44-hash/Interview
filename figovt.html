        <p>Debt instruments issued by a national government, considered the safest form of fixed-income investment.</p>

        <button class="accordion">1. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Treasury Bills are short-term government securities with a maturity of less than 1 year (commonly 91, 182, or 364 days). They are zero-coupon instruments, issued at a discount to their face value and redeemed at par.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>An investor buys a T-bill at a discount (e.g., $9,800 for a $10,000 bill). At maturity, the government pays the full $10,000. The difference ($200) is the investor’s return.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Suppose you buy a 6-month T-bill with a face value of $10,000 at a price of $9,800.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maturity: 6 months</li>
                <li>Redemption: $10,000</li>
                <li>Return: $200 (≈ 4.08% annualized yield)</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Central banks, institutional investors, and corporates as a safe parking place for short-term cash.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Treasury Notes (T-Notes)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Treasury Notes are medium-term government securities with maturities between 2 and 10 years. They pay a fixed coupon (interest) every six months and return the principal at maturity.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>An investor buys a 5-year T-Note with a 4% annual coupon. They receive $40 per $1,000 bond every year (in two $20 payments). At the end of 5 years, the government repays the $1,000 principal.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue price: $1,000</li>
                <li>Coupon: 4% annually ($40/year)</li>
                <li>Maturity: 5 years</li>
                <li>Total Interest: $200</li>
                <li>Redemption: $1,000 at maturity</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Pension funds, insurance companies, and retail investors seeking moderate-term stable income.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Treasury Bonds are long-term government securities with maturities of more than 10 years (often 20 or 30 years). They pay a semi-annual coupon and return principal at maturity.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>Similar to T-Notes but with longer duration and higher interest rate risk. Preferred by investors seeking predictable long-term cash flows.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bond: 30-year T-Bond</li>
                <li>Coupon: 5% ($50 per year per $1,000)</li>
                <li>Payments: $25 every 6 months</li>
                <li>Redemption: $1,000 at maturity</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Long-term investors (e.g., pension funds, sovereign wealth funds) to match long-term liabilities.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Inflation-Linked Bonds (ILBs) / TIPS</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Inflation-Linked Bonds — called TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) in the U.S. — are bonds where the principal is adjusted based on inflation, protecting investors’ real purchasing power. The coupon rate is fixed, but it’s applied to the inflation-adjusted principal.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>Issued with a fixed coupon rate, the principal is adjusted periodically according to an inflation index (like CPI). At maturity, the investor receives the higher of the adjusted principal or the original principal.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Original principal: $1,000</li>
                <li>Coupon: 2% annually</li>
                <li>Inflation: 5%</li>
                <li>Adjusted principal: $1,050</li>
                <li>Coupon payment: 2% of $1,050 = $21</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Conservative investors who want inflation-protected returns.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5. Savings Bonds / National Savings Certificates</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>These are non-marketable government bonds, often issued for retail investors to encourage savings. They usually offer fixed interest and are held until maturity (no secondary trading).</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>Purchased directly from the government or post office, they pay fixed or variable interest and often come with tax benefits.</p>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A 5-year National Savings Certificate with a 6.8% annual interest rate. The investor holds until maturity and receives compounded returns plus principal.</p>
            <blockquote>Used by: Retail investors seeking safe, long-term savings options.</blockquote>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">6. Sovereign Green Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Sovereign Green Bonds are government-issued bonds specifically designed to finance environmentally friendly projects, like renewable energy, climate resilience, or pollution control.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>Same mechanics as a regular bond (coupon + principal), but proceeds must be used for “green” projects. They attract ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) focused investors.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A government issues a 10-year Green Bond with a 3.5% coupon to fund solar energy projects. Coupons are paid semi-annually and the principal is repaid at maturity. The use of proceeds is verified for environmental impact.</p>
            <blockquote>Used by: Institutional investors with ESG mandates or sustainable investment strategies.</blockquote>
