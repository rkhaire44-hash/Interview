            <h4>Quick Orientation</h4>
            <p>Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) are designed to protect investors against inflation by linking either the principal or coupon payments to an official inflation index. Their main purpose is to preserve the investor‚Äôs real purchasing power.</p>

        <button class="accordion">2. Mechanism ‚Äì How It Works</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>1. Principal-Indexed Bonds (Most Common)</h4>
            <p>The face value of the bond increases with inflation. The coupon rate is fixed but is applied to the inflation-adjusted principal.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Original principal: $1,000; Annual coupon: 2%; Inflation: 5%.<br>
            Adjusted principal = $1,000 √ó 1.05 = $1,050.<br>
            Annual coupon = 2% √ó $1,050 = $21.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Coupon-Indexed Bonds (Less Common)</h4>
            <p>The coupon payment is directly linked to inflation, but the principal is fixed.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Principal: $1,000; Coupon: CPI inflation + 1%; Inflation: 4%.<br>
            Annual coupon = 4% + 1% = 5% ‚Üí $50 payment. The principal remains $1,000.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <h4>üá∫üá∏ TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) ‚Äì USA</h4>
            <p>U.S. government bonds whose principal value adjusts with the U.S. CPI-U. Maturities are 5, 10, and 30 years. If deflation occurs, the principal will not fall below the original par value.</p>
            
            <h4>üá¨üáß Index-Linked Gilts ‚Äì United Kingdom</h4>
            <p>UK government bonds where both principal and coupons are linked to the Retail Price Index (RPI), with a lag of about 3 months.</p>

            <h4>üá´üá∑ OATi & OAT‚Ç¨i ‚Äì France</h4>
            <p>French Treasury issues two types: OATi (linked to French CPI) and OAT‚Ç¨i (linked to Eurozone HICP).</p>

            <h4>üáÆüáπ BTP Italia ‚Äì Italy</h4>
            <p>Italian government bonds indexed to the Italian CPI, often sold directly to retail investors.</p>

            <h4>üáØüáµ JGBi ‚Äì Japan</h4>
            <p>Japanese inflation-linked government bonds that link principal to Japan‚Äôs CPI. They include a "deflation floor" ensuring investors receive at least 100% of the original principal.</p>

                <li><strong>Retail Investors:</strong> To preserve the real value of savings.</li>

        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>Breakeven Inflation Rate (BEI) = Nominal Yield ‚Äì Real Yield</strong></p>
            <p>The BEI is the market‚Äôs expectation of average inflation over the bond‚Äôs life. If you expect actual inflation to be higher than the BEI, the inflation-linked bond is attractive. If you expect it to be lower, the nominal bond is better.</p>
             <p><strong>Example:</strong> 10Y Treasury nominal yield = 4.5%; 10Y TIPS real yield = 2.0%.<br>
             BEI ‚âà 4.5% - 2.0% = 2.5%. If you think inflation will average >2.5%, buy TIPS.</p>

                <li><strong>Deflation Risk:</strong> If inflation turns negative, principal and coupons may shrink (though floors often exist).</li>

                <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some ILB markets are less liquid than their nominal counterparts.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Risk:</strong> Inflation adjustments may be taxed as income annually, even though the cash is not received until maturity ("phantom income").</li>
                <li><strong>Real vs. Nominal Yield Mispricing:</strong> If breakeven inflation expectations change, ILBs can underperform.</li>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Q: How does a TIPS bond protect against inflation?</strong><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> Its principal is indexed to the CPI. Coupons are paid on the adjusted principal, and you receive the final inflation-adjusted amount at maturity, preserving purchasing power.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Q: What is ‚Äúbreakeven inflation‚Äù?</strong><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> It‚Äôs the difference between the yield on a nominal bond and an inflation-linked bond of the same maturity. It represents the market's average inflation expectation over that period.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Q: What happens if there‚Äôs deflation?</strong><br>
                <strong>A:</strong> The principal and coupons may shrink. However, many ILBs like TIPS have a "deflation floor," meaning the principal paid at maturity will not be less than the original par value.
