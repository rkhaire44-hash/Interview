        <h1>Municipal Bonds (Sub-Sovereign Bonds)</h1>
        <p>Debt instruments issued by state or local governments to finance public infrastructure, often with tax advantages.</p>

        <button class="accordion">1. General Obligation (GO) Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>GO Bonds are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the issuing municipality. This means repayment is guaranteed by the government’s power to tax residents or raise revenue.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Issuer pledges its taxing authority (e.g., property tax, sales tax) to repay bondholders.</li>
                <li>These are considered the safest type of municipal bonds.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A city issues a 20-year GO bond to build public schools.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coupon: 3.5% per year</li>
                <li>Repayment: Funded by city property tax revenues</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Investors seeking very low-risk, tax-exempt income.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Revenue Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Revenue bonds are backed by revenues generated from a specific project rather than tax revenues. They’re riskier than GO bonds but often offer higher yields.</p>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Repayment depends on the income generated by the project (e.g., toll roads, water utilities, airports).</li>
                <li>If the project underperforms, investors bear more risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A state issues a 30-year revenue bond to fund a toll highway.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coupon: 4.25%</li>
                <li>Repayment: Tolls collected from highway users</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Investors willing to accept slightly more risk for higher tax-free returns.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Special Purpose Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Issued for specific projects or purposes, often backed by dedicated revenue streams (like hotel taxes, parking fees, or stadium revenues).</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A city issues special purpose bonds to build a sports stadium.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Coupon: 4%</li>
                <li>Repayment: Ticket surcharges and parking revenue</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Investors targeting specific municipal projects.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Tax-Free / Taxable Municipal Bonds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tax-Free Munis:</strong> Interest income is exempt from federal tax (and often state/local if you live in the issuing state).</li>
                <li><strong>Taxable Munis:</strong> Issued for projects not eligible for tax-exempt status (e.g., pension funding, economic development).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tax-free GO bond: 3% yield (effective after-tax return might be ~4.5% if you’re in a high tax bracket)</li>
                <li>Taxable muni: 5% yield (but taxed like regular income)</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: High-income investors in high-tax jurisdictions.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5. Agency Bonds (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae)</button>
        <div class="panel">
             <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Agency bonds are issued by U.S. federal agencies or government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to support public policy goals — primarily housing and mortgage markets. They are not municipal bonds, but they sit between sovereign and municipal in risk terms.</p>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fannie Mae (FNMA):</strong> Issues bonds to finance home loans bought from lenders.</li>
                <li><strong>Freddie Mac (FHLMC):</strong> Similar to Fannie Mae, supports mortgage liquidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Ginnie Mae (GNMA):</strong> Fully backed by the U.S. government, guarantees mortgage-backed securities.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Institutional investors for very high-quality, near-sovereign fixed income exposure.</blockquote>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">6. REMIC (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A REMIC is a structured vehicle that issues mortgage-backed securities (MBS) — bonds backed by pools of mortgage loans. Many REMIC securities are issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and are treated as pass-through securities.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>A pool of residential mortgages is packaged into a REMIC.</li>
                <li>Investors receive monthly interest and principal payments as homeowners repay their loans.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>Used by: Fixed income investors seeking mortgage exposure with strong credit backing.</blockquote>
        </div>
