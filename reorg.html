        <button class="accordion">1. Scheme of Arrangement</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A Scheme of Arrangement is a court-approved agreement between a company and its shareholders or creditors that reorganizes their rights. It's often used in mergers, debt restructuring, and capital reorganizations, particularly in Commonwealth jurisdictions.</p>
            
            <h4>Mechanics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A company proposes the scheme.</li>
                <li>Shareholders/creditors vote on it (usually requires a 75% supermajority).</li>
                <li>If approved, the scheme is submitted to a court for sanction.</li>
                <li>Once sanctioned, it becomes legally binding on all parties, even those who voted against it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example – Merger via Scheme</h4>
            <p>Company A wants to acquire Company B. B proposes a scheme where its shareholders get 2 shares of A for every 1 share of B. If approved and sanctioned by the court, all B shareholders are bound by the deal, ensuring a smooth transfer of ownership.</p>
            
            <h4>Interview Q / Model Answer</h4>
            <blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> Why is a scheme of arrangement often used in mergers?<br><strong>A:</strong> Because once it's court-approved, it becomes binding on 100% of shareholders, which is a more certain and efficient way to complete a takeover than a traditional tender offer that relies on individual acceptance.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Receivership / Administration</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A legal process where an external administrator is appointed to take control of a company that cannot meet its debt obligations. The goal is typically to protect creditors by attempting to rescue the business, sell it as a going concern, or maximize asset value before liquidation.</p>
            
            <h4>Shareholder Impact</h4>
            <p>Shareholders usually lose control of the company, and their equity value often drops significantly, sometimes to zero. A successful restructuring that preserves shareholder value is rare.</p>

            <h4>Interview Q / Model Answer</h4>
            <blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> What is the key difference between receivership and liquidation?<br><strong>A:</strong> Receivership (or administration) is primarily a rescue attempt—it aims to save or sell the business as a viable entity. Liquidation is the end—it's the process of closing the business down completely and selling off its individual assets.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Liquidation / Winding Up</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Liquidation is the final stage of a company’s life. It ceases all operations, a liquidator is appointed to sell all its assets, the proceeds are used to pay off creditors in a specific order of priority, and the company is legally dissolved.</p>
            
            <h4>Priority of Payout</h4>
             <ol>
                <li>Secured creditors</li>
                <li>Preferential creditors (e.g., employees for unpaid wages)</li>
                <li>Unsecured creditors</li>
                <li>Subordinated debt holders</li>
                <li>Shareholders (who often receive little to nothing)</li>
            </ol>
           
            <h4>Interview Q / Model Answer</h4>
            <blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> In what order are stakeholders paid during liquidation?<br><strong>A:</strong> The order is strictly defined: secured creditors are first, followed by preferential and unsecured creditors. Shareholders are last in line and only get paid if any funds remain after all other debts have been settled.</blockquote>
